            <h3>HOW WAS 24 OCEAN BORN?</h3>
            <p>We came into being because of an unfortunate incident in the past. My late grandfather, a patient of diabetes, used to encounter multiple skin allergies and other ailments along with dry skin regularly. The reason being, chemically loaded soaps on sensitice skin.
                With this problem in hand, we started with our research and came up with NOVEL AND SUSTAINABLE ways to prepare organic soaps that are gentle on your skin and can be used for a number of different purposes.
            They say when life gives you lemons, made a lemonade and yes, we quite literally did that ! </p>
            <p>After referring to a number of statistics, we discovered that 9.3% of the global population is experiencing several skin allergies for the same reasons as my grandfather did, so we decided to
                go public with the idea of a premium range of perfectly formulated organic soaps.
            </p>
            <p>It was complete inquisitiveness combined with our scientific temperament that brought us to create the perfect formula fit for various skin types and textures.</p>
            <p>We believe your beauty is our passion where we take care of all kinds of skins and textures. Our skincare essentials are designed to make you feel your best and most confident self. </p>
