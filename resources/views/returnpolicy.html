                Please do not send your purchase back to the manufacturer.

                If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.</p>

            <b><p>Late or Missing Refunds</p></b>

            <p>If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again.

                Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.
                
                Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted.
                
                If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at {email address}.</p>

            <h3>Gifts</h3>

            <p>If the item was marked as a gift when purchased and shipped directly to you, you’ll receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned item is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to you.
